        > We might reject any issues that can't be solved within the repository, or reports that are too general. For example:
        > 
        > <details>
        >   <summary><b>"Kettu crashes upon starting..."</b></summary>
        >   > There are lots of different things that could be causing this, but it's probably not related to this repository.
        > </details>
        > <details>
        >   <summary><b>"Kettu freezes on splash screen..."</b></summary>
        >   > The issue is too general and should be reported only when it occurs after an update to a specific Discord version or after a specific action or configuration has been made within Kettu.
        > </details>
        > <details>
        >   <summary><b>"Kettu refuses to install/stuck on downloading..."</b></summary>
        >   > This is an external issue (sideloading) that does not have a place in this repository. If it's a problem with Kettu Manager, report it to the <a href="https://github.com/C0C0B01/KettuManager">appropriate repository</a>.
        > </details>

        > If you think that your problem belongs to one of these, you should avoid submitting this report unless you are told to do so.
        > 
        > Please report the problem or ask for help in the appropriate place. For example, if the problem occurs in Kettu Manager, report it in the Kettu Manager repository.
